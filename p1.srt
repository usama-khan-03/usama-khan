4
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:33,125
drew on the screen right here. I don't know
what to do. No, a little bit farther down,

5
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:39,889
farther down, right there. Yeah, there you go.
Oh, that's not working.

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:52,361

00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,021
There we go. OK, after we move this.

There we go, I think that worked. Alright, thanks

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,061
Ah, it's catching on fire.

16
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,589
